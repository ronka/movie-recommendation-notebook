The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n",

    "- What is the perfect runtime? is there such a thing?\n",

    "- Are people consistently watching the same genre films? e.g. People who watch war, crime and thriller films likely to watch only those genres\n",
